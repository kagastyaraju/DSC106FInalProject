    <section id="introduction">
      <h2>Gravity's Constant Pull</h2>
      <p>
        At rest, your body operates in a state of calm equilibrium, where your heart, blood vessels, and brain work in harmony to maintain steady blood flow. 
        
      <p>
        But when you rise from a seated or lying position, gravity pulls blood toward your feet, disrupting that tranquility and causing your blood pressure to drop in a phenomenon called orthostatic hypotension. 
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        That brief drop in blood pressure may cause lightheadedness, dizziness, or even vision changes as your body quickly activates compensatory mechanisms to restore proper blood flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let’s explore the intricate relationships between blood pressure, brain blood flow, and your body’s resilience through our interactive visualization based on real expiremental data.

        <p><strong>Stand-Up Phase (1800-1920s):</strong> Upon standing, your body activates multiple compensatory mechanisms—your heart rate increases, blood vessels constrict, and your breathing pattern may change to help stabilize blood pressure.</p>
        <p><strong>Sit-Down Phase (1920-1980s):</strong> When sitting back down, your body must readjust again as blood flow patterns reverse, sometimes causing a temporary blood pressure spike before returning to baseline.</p>

    <!-- Conclusion: Takeaway -->
    <section id="conclusion">
      <h2>The Remarkable Balance: Your Body's Hidden Resilience</h2>
      <p>
        Every time you stand up, gravity challenges your body by briefly lowering your blood pressure. Yet, thanks to a sophisticated network of automatic regulatory mechanisms, your brain continues to receive a stable flow of blood.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main takeaway from this project is that even when external forces disrupt your equilibrium, your body is incredibly strong and designed to protect its most vital functions. Our story clearly demonstrates this by showing that, despite a dip in blood pressure, brain blood flow remains remarkably constant. This real-time depiction of your body's dynamic balance powerfully illustrates its extraordinary resilience and underscores the human body's amazing inherent strength.
